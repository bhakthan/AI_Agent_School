## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, discovery
- **Design Personality**: Clean, professional, and approachable with a modern tech aesthetic
- **Visual Metaphors**: Code blocks, AI connections, cookbook/recipe metaphors
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface - clean and minimal but with rich content presentation

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep teal blue (#1a7f64) - professional, trustworthy, and aligned with a technical audience
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for structure and organization
- **Accent Color**: Brighter teal (#10a37f) for CTAs and important elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blues and teals convey reliability and technical expertise, creating trust
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios between text and backgrounds (minimum 4.5:1)
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background/foreground: #ffffff/#2d333a (7.36:1)
  - Card/card-foreground: #f9fafb/#2d333a (7.05:1)
  - Primary/primary-foreground: #10a37f/#ffffff (4.52:1)
  - Secondary/secondary-foreground: #f3f4f6/#2d333a (6.74:1)
  - Accent/accent-foreground: #10a37f/#ffffff (4.52:1)
  - Muted/muted-foreground: #f3f4f6/#71767f (3.67:1 - large text only)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif system for both headings and body text for clarity and readability
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, body text, and code blocks
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, and highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Comfortable line lengths (66-80 characters), adequate line spacing (1.5)
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent typographic scale with limited font sizes
- **Which fonts**: Inter for headings and UI elements, Source Sans Pro for body text, Fira Mono for code
- **Legibility Check**: All fonts are highly legible at various sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Category tiles > Example list > Code block > Configuration panel
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous space between sections, with tighter spacing within related groups
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid with responsive breakpoints
- **Responsive Approach**: Desktop-first with adaptations for tablet and mobile
- **Content Density**: Medium density for examples list, lower density for code and explanation sections

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions between sections to maintain context
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Most important elements animate first
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations limited to navigation changes and state transitions

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for examples, tabs for category navigation, code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Component Customization**: Custom code block styling with copy button and language indicator
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for UI elements, with code-related and AI-specific icon set
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary navigation, category filters, example cards, code blocks
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px-based spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack layout, collapsible sections, and prioritized content

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable elements
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout interface
- **Brand Alignment**: Subtle references to OpenAI's visual identity

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and essential UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Complex examples may be difficult to present in limited space
- **Edge Case Handling**: Provide expandable sections for detailed explanations
- **Technical Constraints**: API request limitations, code execution environment constraints

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Structure should support easy addition of new examples
- **Testing Focus**: Verify code examples work as described
- **Critical Questions**: How to keep examples updated with API changes?

## Reflection
- Using a cookbook metaphor provides a familiar mental model that aligns with how developers learn and apply new techniques
- We're assuming users have basic familiarity with APIs and JavaScript/TypeScript
- Exceptional elements would include live API integration for direct testing within the application
