  - Muted background: oklch(0.9 0.02 240) with muted foreground: oklch(0.4 0.02 240)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Modern sans-serif for headings paired with a highly readable sans-serif for body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between section titles (large, bold), concept names (medium, semibold), descriptions (regular), and code (monospace)
- **Font Personality**: Professional, technical yet accessible
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height (1.6 for body text), optimal line length (66 characters), adequate paragraph spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of weight and size throughout the application
- **Which fonts**: 'Inter' for headings and UI elements, 'Roboto' for body text, 'Fira Code' for code examples
- **Legibility Check**: All fonts offer excellent legibility at various sizes and support technical terminology

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Use size, color, and motion to guide users through the conceptual hierarchy
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous white space to avoid overwhelming users with complex concepts
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid with clear sections for navigation, visualization, and code examples
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack visualization and code vertically on smaller screens; side-by-side on larger screens
- **Content Density**: Balance between comprehensive information and visual clarity, with progressive disclosure for details

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Animations will show the flow of data between agent components and highlight active parts of the system
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary animations for data flow in visualizations, subtle transitions for UI navigation
