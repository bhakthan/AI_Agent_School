# Azure AI Agents Visualization Platform PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide an interactive, educational platform for exploring Azure AI agent patterns, concepts, and implementation best practices with integration of Azure AI services.
- **Success Indicators**: Comprehensive coverage of agent patterns, clear implementation guidance through code examples, and effective integration of Azure AI services best practices.
- **Experience Qualities**: Informative, Interactive, Professional

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Content Showcase with Interactive Features
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (educational content) and Interacting (with visualizations)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Developers need to understand how to implement various agent patterns using Azure AI services effectively.
- **User Context**: Users will likely be developers seeking to learn about agent architectures and implementation patterns in Azure.
- **Critical Path**: Browse patterns → Understand architecture → Explore code examples → Learn Azure service integration → Apply knowledge
- **Key Moments**:
  1. Visual exploration of agent pattern architectures
  2. Code examples for implementation reference
  3. Azure AI services integration best practices discovery

## Essential Features
1. **Agent Pattern Explorer**
   - Functionality: Interactive visualizations of common agent patterns with nodes and connections
   - Purpose: Help users understand agent architectures visually
   - Success criteria: Clear representation of component relationships and data flow

2. **Implementation Playbooks**
   - Functionality: Step-by-step guides with code samples in both TypeScript and Python
   - Purpose: Provide concrete implementation examples for each pattern
   - Success criteria: Complete, working code examples that follow best practices

3. **Azure AI Services Integration**
   - Functionality: Comprehensive catalog of relevant Azure AI services with pattern-specific integration guidance
   - Purpose: Show how to leverage Azure services effectively for each pattern
   - Success criteria: Clear mapping between patterns and services with actionable implementation advice

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, technical clarity, and inspiration
- **Design Personality**: Modern, technical yet approachable, professional
- **Visual Metaphors**: Network diagrams, code blocks, cloud architecture
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced - clean interface with rich visualizations

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Primarily monochromatic with accent colors for emphasis
- **Primary Color**: Blue/purple (oklch(0.65 0.2 250)) - representing Azure's core color palette
- **Secondary Colors**: Teal blue (oklch(0.65 0.18 200)) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Amber/gold (oklch(0.85 0.15 85)) for highlighting important elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and reliability; gold accents convey value and excellence
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between text and background across all components
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background/foreground: oklch(0.98 0.005 240)/oklch(0.2 0.02 240)
  - Card/card-foreground: oklch(0.95 0.01 240)/oklch(0.2 0.02 240)
  - Primary/primary-foreground: oklch(0.65 0.2 250)/oklch(0.98 0.005 240)
  - Secondary/secondary-foreground: oklch(0.65 0.18 200)/oklch(0.98 0.005 240)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Professional sans-serif for headings (Inter) paired with clean, readable font for body text (Roboto)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text through weight and size
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, technical
- **Readability Focus**: Comfortable line lengths and generous spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of fonts across similar elements
- **Fonts**: Inter for headings, Roboto for body text, Fira Code for code blocks
- **Legibility Check**: High contrast between text and background, adequately sized text

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Card-based layout guides users through content sections
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to avoid cluttered interfaces
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid for responsive layouts
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-friendly design with appropriate component stacking
- **Content Density**: Moderate density with strategic use of whitespace

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for content sections, tabs for navigation, accordions for detailed information
- **Component Customization**: Subtle shadcn customizations for Azure-themed appearance
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and selected states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent visual language
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary navigation via tabs, secondary via cards and accordions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack components vertically on smaller screens

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text elements

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Design to accommodate additional agent patterns and Azure services
- **Testing Focus**: Verify code examples work correctly and match visual representations
- **Critical Questions**: How to keep content updated with Azure's evolving services?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines visual learning with practical implementation guidance
- The integration of Azure AI services with each pattern provides context-specific guidance that's often missing from general documentation
- Adding interactive elements to aid understanding makes this platform more valuable than static documentation
