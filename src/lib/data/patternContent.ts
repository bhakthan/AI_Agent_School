    id: 'prompt-chaining',
    name: 'Prompt Chaining',
    longDescription: `
      Prompt chaining is a technique that breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler steps, where each step is handled by a separate LLM call. 
      The output from one LLM call becomes the input for the next, creating a chain of processing that progressively works toward solving the original problem.
      
      This approach mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex tasks into manageable pieces. Each LLM call can be specialized for its specific subtask, 
      with prompts engineered to elicit the exact type of processing needed at that stage.
      
      The chain can include decision points (gates) that determine whether to proceed, retry, or take alternative paths based on the quality or content of intermediate results.

    id: 'parallelization',
    name: 'Parallelization',
    longDescription: `
      The Parallelization pattern involves executing multiple LLM calls simultaneously with the same or similar inputs, then combining their outputs. 
      This approach contrasts with sequential processing and can be used for various purposes including redundancy, perspective diversification, or task decomposition.
      
      In this pattern, the same query might be processed by multiple different prompts, different model parameters (temperature, top_p), or even different LLM models entirely. 
      The results are then aggregated using methods ranging from simple concatenation to sophisticated synthesis (potentially using another LLM call).
      
      Parallelization enables more robust outputs by collecting multiple perspectives or approaches to the same problem, and can improve reliability through redundancy.

    id: 'orchestrator-worker',
    name: 'Orchestrator-Worker',
    longDescription: `
      The Orchestrator-Worker pattern employs a hierarchical approach where a central "orchestrator" LLM breaks down complex problems into subtasks 
      and delegates them to specialized "worker" LLMs. The orchestrator maintains overall context and responsibility for the final solution, 
      while workers focus on solving specific parts of the problem.
      
      This pattern is particularly valuable for complex tasks that benefit from specialization. The orchestrator can dynamically assign tasks 
      based on their nature, track progress, integrate results, and handle exceptions. Workers can be optimized for their specific subtasks, 
      with prompts and potentially even different models tailored to their responsibilities.
      
      A synthesizer component often combines the workers' outputs into a coherent final result, ensuring consistency and completeness.

      "Effective division of labor for complex multi-component tasks",
      "Allows specialization of workers for different types of subtasks",

    id: 'evaluator-optimizer',
    name: 'Evaluator-Optimizer',
    longDescription: `
      The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern creates a feedback loop where one LLM generates content and another evaluates its quality,
      providing feedback for improvement. This iterative process continues until the output meets defined quality criteria or a
      maximum number of iterations is reached.
      
      This pattern mimics human revision processes, where initial drafts are critiqued and refined. The evaluator component applies
      specific quality criteria, potentially checking for accuracy, completeness, tone, style, and other relevant factors. The feedback
      is then used by the generator to produce an improved version.
      
      The pattern can be implemented with separate LLMs for generation and evaluation, or with the same LLM using different prompts
      that establish distinct roles. Using separate models can help ensure independent assessment.

    advantages: [
      "Promotes continuous improvement through feedback loops",

    id: 'routing',
    name: 'Routing',
    longDescription: `
      The Routing pattern involves using an LLM to classify or categorize an input and then direct it to the most appropriate
      specialized handler. This approach allows for separation of concerns, with the router focusing on classification and
      specialized components handling domain-specific processing.
      
      The router typically acts as a first-pass analysis layer, determining the nature, intent, or domain of the input. Based on
      this classification, the input is directed to one of several possible paths, each optimized for handling a particular type
      of request or content.
      
      This pattern is particularly valuable in systems that need to handle diverse inputs requiring different types of expertise
      or processing approaches. It allows for modularity and specialization while maintaining a single entry point.

      "Enables specialization of components for different types of inputs",

      "Provides a clear separation of concerns between classification and processing",
      "Can improve efficiency by directing inputs to optimized paths",

  {
    id: 'autonomous-workflow',
    name: 'Autonomous Workflow',
    longDescription: `
      The Autonomous Workflow pattern creates a self-directed agent that interacts with its environment in a continuous
      loop of perception, reasoning, and action. The LLM receives feedback from the environment after each action and uses
      this updated context to determine its next steps.
      
      This pattern is distinguished by its dynamic nature - rather than following a predetermined sequence, the agent
      adapts its behavior based on environmental feedback. The LLM maintains state across iterations, building up context
      and history that inform future decisions.
      
      The environment can include various tools and capabilities that the agent can leverage, such as search engines,
      calculators, databases, or APIs. The agent chooses which tools to use based on its assessment of the current situation
      and task requirements.

  {
    id: 'reflexion',
    name: 'Reflexion',
    longDescription: `
      The Reflexion pattern implements a self-improvement cycle where an LLM critically evaluates its own outputs and
      iteratively refines them. This meta-cognitive approach involves generating an initial response, then explicitly
      reflecting on its quality, identifying issues, and producing an improved version.
      
      Unlike simpler feedback loops, Reflexion emphasizes the agent's ability to generate its own feedback rather than
      relying on external evaluation. The reflection process may consider multiple aspects including accuracy,
      completeness, reasoning quality, ethical considerations, and alignment with goals.
      
      The pattern can involve multiple iterations, with each cycle potentially focusing on different aspects of
      improvement. This creates a progressive refinement process that can yield significantly better results than
      single-pass generation.

  {
    id: 'plan-and-execute',
    name: 'Plan and Execute',
    longDescription: `
      The Plan and Execute pattern divides problem-solving into two distinct phases: first creating a structured plan,
      then systematically executing each step. The planning phase breaks down complex tasks into ordered, manageable
      subtasks, potentially with dependencies and contingencies. The execution phase then works through these subtasks,
      potentially adapting the plan based on intermediate results.
      
      This pattern enables more effective handling of complex, multi-step tasks by making the planning process explicit
      rather than implicit. The generated plan serves as a roadmap that guides execution and can be reviewed before
      proceeding.
      
      The pattern can include replanning steps where the original plan is revised based on new information discovered
      during execution. This allows for adaptation while maintaining an overall strategic approach.
