# Pattern Demo React Flow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Container Height Issue
**Problem**: The React Flow visualization containers were too small (400px height).
**Solution**: Increased the container height to 500px for PatternDemo and 600px for PatternVisualizer and AdvancedPatternVisualizer for better usability.

### 2. Node Clustering Issue  
**Problem**: Nodes were clustering in the top-left corner on load and during simulation due to multiple `fitView` calls. Additionally, the "Reset Layout" button was causing nodes to cluster.
**Solution**: 
- Disabled `autoFitView` in StandardFlowVisualizerWithProvider (changed from `true` to `false`)
- Modified `onReady` callback to only call `fitView` on initial load when not running simulation
- Updated `resetDemo` to conditionally call `fitView` only when not starting a simulation
- Added conditional check in `runDemo` to avoid calling `fitView` during simulation
- Removed automatic `fitView` prop from ReactFlow components
- **Fixed "Reset Layout" function to not call `fitView`** which was causing clustering
- **Fixed dimension change effect to not call `fitView` during animation**

### 3. Simulation Animation Issue
**Problem**: The "Start Simulation" button was not triggering any visible animations in the Agent Patterns visualization.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `startSimulation` function to actually create and display data flows
- Added proper node status updates (processing → complete)
- Added edge animations during simulation
- Added automatic simulation termination after flows complete

### 4. Drag Hint Overlay Issue
**Problem**: "Nodes are draggable" hint was appearing on top of nodes and could interfere with rendering.
**Solution**: 
- Repositioned the drag hint to bottom-right corner instead of top-center
- Reduced display time from 6 seconds to 4 seconds
- Made the hint smaller and less intrusive
- Increased z-index to ensure proper layering

### 5. TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Several TypeScript compilation errors due to CSS property types, missing icon imports, and incorrect type definitions.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed CSS property type issues by using `as const` assertions for CSS values
- Replaced missing `StepForward` icon with `CaretRight` 
- Replaced missing `QuestionCircle` icon with `Question`
- Fixed `useStableFlowContainer` hook usage 
- Added proper type casting for node data properties
- Fixed type casting issues for availableNodes and availableEdges props

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/interactive-demos/PatternDemo.tsx`
  - Container height: 400px → 500px
  - Disabled autoFitView to prevent unwanted re-centering
  - Added conditional fitView calls to prevent clustering
  - Repositioned and improved drag hint
  - Fixed TypeScript type errors

- `/src/components/visualization/PatternVisualizer.tsx`
  - Container height: 400px → 600px
  - Disabled autoFitView to prevent unwanted re-centering
  - Added conditional fitView calls to prevent clustering during animation
  - **Fixed "Reset Layout" function to not call `fitView`**
  - **Fixed dimension change effect to not call `fitView` during animation**
  - **Fixed `startSimulation` to actually create visible animations**
  - **Fixed TypeScript errors: icon imports, hook usage, type casting**
  - Commented out fitView call during simulation

- `/src/components/visualization/AdvancedPatternVisualizer.tsx`
  - Container height: 500px → 600px
  - Removed automatic `fitView` prop from ReactFlow component
  - **Fixed "Reset Layout" function to not call `fitView`**
  - **Fixed `startSimulation` to actually create visible animations**
  - **Fixed TypeScript errors: icon imports, type casting for props**

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Agent Patterns → Visualization tab**:
   - Select any pattern (e.g., "Prompt Chaining")
   - Click on the "Visualization" tab
   - Verify nodes are properly positioned and not clustered in top-left
   - **Click "Start Simulation" button** and verify that:
     - Nodes light up and show processing states
     - Edges animate with data flows
     - Animation runs for a few seconds then stops
   - **Click "Reset Layout" button** and verify nodes stay in their original positions (no clustering)
   - Test both "Auto" and "Step by Step" animation modes

2. **Agent Patterns → Implementation code playbook → Interactive Example tab**:
   - Select any pattern (e.g., "Prompt Chaining")
   - Click on the "Interactive Example" tab
   - Verify:
     - Container height is adequate (500px)
     - Nodes are properly positioned and not clustered in top-left
     - **Enter input text and click "Start Simulation"** - nodes should not jump to top-left
     - Nodes maintain their positions during execution
     - Drag hint appears in bottom-right corner and is less intrusive

**Note**: Both visualization components have "Start Simulation" buttons that trigger animations. The fixes prevent node clustering during these animations by controlling when `fitView` is called.

## Key Changes Made

```typescript
// Before: Small container with autoFitView enabled
<StableFlowContainer style={{ height: 400 }}>
  <StandardFlowVisualizerWithProvider
    autoFitView={true}
    // ...
  />
</StableFlowContainer>

// After: Larger container with controlled fitView
<StableFlowContainer style={{ height: 500 }}>
  <StandardFlowVisualizerWithProvider
    autoFitView={false}
    // ...
  />
</StableFlowContainer>
```

```typescript
// Before: Automatic fitView on every render
<ReactFlow
  fitView
  // ...
/>

// After: No automatic fitView
<ReactFlow
  // ...
/>
```

These changes ensure that React Flow visualizations across the application provide a better user experience with proper node positioning, adequate container space, and no unwanted re-centering during simulations.
